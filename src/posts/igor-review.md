I heard IGOR a lot later than most people, only listening to it becasue of the raving reviews that my friends gave to the album.
After a few failed listens, I decided to just set away 40 minutes to listen to the album, wiht no distractions, just focusing on the music. And that was probably the best decision I could have made.

In 2019, Tyler, The Creator dropped IGOR to both critical and commercial success, topping the Billboard hot 100, and eventually winning Tyler his first Grammy for Best Rap album.
While he was thankful for the Grammy, Tyler believed that putting his album under rap was putting it under a stereotype that it did not fit, and I definitely agree, which I'll get into during the album.

Now let's get into the tracks.

# 1. **IGOR'S THEME**

The album starts off with a bang, with heavy synths and booming production in the background, almost sounding like a droning noise, until finally the beat drops, and the main portion of the track arrives. It's very heavy on the synths, which is a part of its charm, and it subtly introduces a lot of the topics on the album. It's a mix of jazzy and electronic, and something very unique that I've never heard before this album. Then, at the end of the song, the main parts drop away to a quick electronic riff reminiscent of retro video games.

## 8.5/10: Incredible Intro, but it gets even better
-------------

# 2. **EARFQUAKE**
The next track is EARFQUAKE, one of Tyler's most popular songs of all time. The song is incredibly catchy, but also unique in the same way that IGOR'S THEME is. It has deep synths in the background, with production that makes the track a joy to listen to. This also introduces Tyler's high-pitched vocals, which are a staple of this album, and we'll see them later tracklist as well. 

The theme of the song is breakup, with Tyler repeatly saying "don't leave, it's my fault" throughout the track, giving a sense of desperation to keep the relationship going, even if it isn't healthy for him.

One of the best parts of this song is the Playboi Carti feature, and while it is completely unintelligble in true Carti fashion, it adds another layer to the song.

## 9.2/10: beautiful track, with incredible production
-------------

# 3. **I THINK**

One of my personal favorite tracks off the album, I THINK is more an ode to love and how Tyler's character is taking it. The song is a lot more upbeat, and one of the best dance songs off of the album. Solange's vocals are also amazing in this track. But the best part of this song is definitely the bridge.

The bridge mixes the booming production of the previous songs, with the jazzy element of EARFQUAKE, but also adds in a nice airy flute in the background, and it is just a masterpiece of production, with Tyler just showing off his skills. Solange is also incredible in this bridge.

Then, after the bridge, the song drops off, and all we hear is silence until the "four, four, four, four" introduces the final beat drop.

At the end we finish off with some beautiful piano to smooth out the already close-to-perfect track.

## 9.5/10: i think im falling in love
-------------

# 4: **EXACTLY WHAT YOU RUN FROM YOU END UP CHASING**

Not much to say here, Jerrod Carmichael speaking facts.

## --/10: Interlude
-------------

# 5: **RUNNING OUT OF TIME**
This is one of the weaker songs of the album in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's on IGOR, so it's going to be amazing; but I just don't think it holds up to some of the other tracks.

It's a lot more stripped down than the other tracks, with a few synths, bells, but at some points, it has some of the most complex production on the album. When tyler is speaking, the background tends to be simple, as this is is the closest we have come so far to Tyler actually rapping.

On a side note, Childish Gambino is beautiful on this song, and I wish there was a version with him on Spotify.

The song ends with MIDI synthy pianos flying between left and right, which is a cool way to end it off in my opinion.

## 8.3/10: not bad but still weaker than some of the other tracks
-------------

# 6: **NEW MAGIC WAND**

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window.

By the time that line drops, the song breaks loose.

It is a masterclass of synth and production, with sinister laughs at the beginning songs, and lyrics that show how truly demented the character of IGOR is chasing after this guy who already has a girlfriend.

The evil production coupled with Tyler's desperate lyrics show the lengths that Igor is willing to go to get this guy, to the point where he will kill his crush's girlfriend.

In the middle of the song, the song abruptly stops with one of the only sounds being almost a droning bell.

Then, the song breaks loose again, this time with even more energy as Tyler is almost screaming into the microphone with the synth continuing to go on in the background.

By the way, in the song, its implied that the "magic wand" is a pew pew weapon.

## 9.8/10: wow.
-------------

# 7: **A BOY IS A GUN***

This song is amazing. Not just because it uses one of the most iconic and pretty samples of all time (Bound), but because it knows that the pace of the album needs to slow down, so the song itself is more laidback. 
At this point, the song is a turning point, where Igor ends up realizing that this boy isn't good for him, and his actually controlling him. The title is a play on "A girl is a gun"
Even though this song uses the Bound sample, Tyler's production skills still make this track undoubtedly an IGOR track. This song also shows a lot more of the high-pitched voice that we saw in EARFQUAKE.

## 8.9/10: Not as catchy as EARFQUAKE, but it's uniqueness and sound structure set it apart.
-------------

# 8: **PUPPET**

At the beginning this song is very simple, with just a repeating set of 3 piano keys with a soft synth around it. But as the song goes on, the song layers on top of itself. 
Kanye's vocals are just the cherry on top of a genuinely beautiful song. 
The song continues the discussion of Igor's love interest being bad for him, with the main theme in this song being that Igor is being controlled like a puppet.

Then Jerrod Carmichael comes in with another banger line to end off the song and transition into the next track: What's Good.

## 9.2/10: Kanye and Tyler need more songs together.
-------------
# 9: **WHAT'S GOOD**

This song starts out evil like NEW MAGIC WAND, but it does so with even more venom, with Tyler first saying his lines through distortion, and a sinister background sound.
This song feels almost like a venting session, where Igor is getting all of his thoughts out.

Then, like a lot of other songs, the track grinds to a sudden halt, with only Tyler repeating "I see the light," before the best beat drop of the album.

The rest of the song is Tyler rapping normally, for one of the first times in the album as a whole.



## 8.7/10: It's a good song, but like RUNNING OUT OF TIME, there are better tracks.
-------------

# **10: GONE, GONE / THANK YOU**

I've always really loved Tyler's double or triple songs, and I alwyas think that their some of the best of their respective albums, and this is no different. This song uses some more of the high pitched voice, but in a way to show that Igor is accepting of the relationship and the fact that they won't be together. The lyrics are beautiful and represent a sort of coming to terms while still being bitter.

The line that represents this the best is "The bandaid is falling off now,"

About halfway into GONE, GONE, Tyler shifts from airy vocals to a more grounded representation of Igor with his rapping verse, which is one of the best in the album as a whole. The repeating deep vocals in the background of this verse saying "my love is gone" also adds to the vibe of the song, cementing it as one of the best, and we haven't even gotten to the second part.

After Tyler's verse, we get another fire Jerrod Carmichael quote, and we switch to the second half.

This verse is more about being thankful for the past experiences rather than being sad about the fact that it's gone. It's beautiful messaging and really encaptures the soul of the album.

THANK YOU feels like an amalgamation of the whole album, with connections back to almost all of the first half of the album, making it a great song to tie together the feelings of heartbreak.

## 10/10: a perfect song.
-------------

# 11: **I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE**
This song feels like a little bit of Igor trying to hide the fact that he still has feelings by repeating the fact that he doesn't love the guy he's talking to, just to try to convince himself that he doesn't love him anymore. This has a distorted guitar, but switches to one of the more pure and airy sounding tracks on the album, but still having hints of the synth that makes IGOR so special.

## 8.8/10: Great song, but again, weaker than others.
-------------

# 12: **ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?**

In almost a way to try an save the friendship, Igor is asking if they are still friends. The song is catchy, and perfectly encapsulates the feeling of an end, with it giving me a vibe of a TV show ending. The guitar on this song is the star, with it playing the main role of the melody, with some piano following it in the background. The song ends on an overall positive note, with Tyler writing "I don't wanna end this season on a bad episode." 

Then, the song ends with a droning synth, similar to the opening in IGOR'S THEME. The whole album is able to be looped around, representing the circular feelings that Igor is going through.

## 9.4/10: One of the best outro tracks I've heard.
-------------


# **OVERALL TAKES**

This album really is a masterpiece, and isn't afraid to take risks. It isn't necessarily a rap album, but more of a combination of a bunch of different genres, whcih truly shows the talent that Tyler has as a producer, and a creator of worlds.

# 9.1/10: One of the best albums of all time.
